If you’re using macOS, you may see the message “permission denied” when you try to run django-admin. This is because, on Unix-based systems like macOS, a file must be marked as “executable” before it can be run as a program. To do this, open Terminal.app and navigate (using the cd command) to the directory where django-admin is installed, then run the command sudo chmod +x django-admin.
